# Don't ask for connects

It has become possible and incredibly easy even to be able to discover, locate and connect with people in the 21st century.

You should hence only be seeking guidance on who you should look to be connecting with.

The locating, reaching out and connecting — now that part you can and should be able to do on your own.

Being able to locate and connect with people is a skill. Skills that stand you in good stead in the 21st century. Look to build them.
