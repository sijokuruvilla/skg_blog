# Projects worth pursuing

> The decision making framework I use and advocate.

* Reduces human effort
* Increases human output
* Enhances human happiness
* Reduces human suffering

Any project that satisfies any of these 4 conditions is worth pursuing.

Even if its only for a single person. Even if that single person is you.

Never let anyone tell you otherwise.
