All my notes are drafts

All my notes may be treated as drafts. It needs to be reviewed, edited and rewritten. I tend to publish immediately after I have written and look to get back at a later point to refine them. Sometimes I do and most times I donâ€™t. This approach runs the risk of some or most notes not making it to their final drafts. With the publish only after review approach, I run the risk of some (or most) notes never being published. I choose the former.

Copy and innovate

My personal website and the way I am going about it has been heavily inspired by the personal websites of Paul Graham and Derek Sivers. Elements I really liked I have attempted to copy as it is.
