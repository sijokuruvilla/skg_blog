About 

Founding CEO of Startup Village

Now

I am primarily engaged with building out the non profit, Rethink. Most of my time and mindshare goes into that.

I also undertake independent consulting engagements. Usually have a max of two at a time.

I have been offering a course at a nearby business school as guest faculty. Doing it for the fun of it than anything else.

Aside of all that, I end up spending an inordinate amount of time playing board games and helping others discover the joy of board games.

All my notes are drafts

All my notes may be treated as drafts. It needs to be reviewed, edited and rewritten. I tend to publish immediately after I have written and look to get back at a later point to refine them. Sometimes I do and most times I donâ€™t. This approach runs the risk of some or most notes not making it to their final drafts. With the publish only after review approach, I run the risk of some (or most) notes never being published. I choose the former.

Copy and innovate

My personal website and the way I am going about it has been heavily inspired by the personal websites of Paul Graham and Derek Sivers. Elements I really liked I have attempted to copy as it is.
