# Nothing before 11am 

My mornings belong to me. I am a morning person and mornings happen to be my most productive time. Mornings are also when I attend to my priorty activities. So yes, nothing before 11am. 

# Copy and innovate

My personal website and the way I am going about it has been inspired by the personal websites of Paul Graham and Derek Sivers. 

# No comments no tracking

The site is devoid of any form of commenting, tracking or analytics. Prefer it that way. Easier on the mind and on the code. 

# All my notes are drafts

I tend to publish immediately after I have written and look to get back at a later point to refine them if at all. 

# I don't accept mementos

Yes. I have heard the argument several times over - its a gesture and yada yada. Well, for my side of the argument, it's an inconvenience to me - just plain carrying it back, keeping it at my place and throwing it away at a later point in time. I neither wish that you inconvenience me by giving a memento nor do I wish that you inconvenience yourself by getting one. Wish to excuse myself from any polite conversations on the matter further at the expense of coming off as rude or insensitive. Different people have different preferences and ways of viewing things. I'm just respecting mine. 

# I don't carry business cards

I don't. I don't intend to have one also anymore. You don't need a card anymore. 

# I don't pick up calls from unknown numbers

I just don't. I also don't save most numbers on my phone. 

# I don't do connects

You may mail the person you wish to connect to and mark me in cc. That also makes it easier for me to put in a word if I wish to. 

# I donâ€™t prefer calls

Email works best.
