# All my notes are drafts

All my notes may be treated as drafts. It needs to be reviewed, edited and rewritten. I tend to publish immediately after I have written and look to get back at a later point to refine them. Sometimes I do and most times I don't. This approach runs the risk of some or most notes not making it to their final drafts. With the publish only after review approach,I run the risk of some (or most) notes never being published. I choose the former.
