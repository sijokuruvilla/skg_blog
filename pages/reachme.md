## Best way to reach me

Twitter would be the best way to reach me. 

Twitter is the only messaging service for which I have notifications enabled on my phone. So of the lot, that would hands down be the best way to reach me. 

For any aspects related to guidance on any matter, you are best advised to mail in to v@r. (v@r - volunteers@rethinkfoundation.in)

Should it be a matter that you absolutely have to reach me personally, you may write to me at skg@sijokuruvilla.in. 

FB messages & LinkedIn would be perhaps see the slowest response times. I check those inboxes infrequently. 

I also prefer not to be reached on my phone by means of a call or a text unless its both important & urgent.
