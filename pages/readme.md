Some of the ways in which I go about organising my life, work and this site

Nothing before 11am 

My mornings belong to me. I am a morning person and mornings happen to be my most productive time. Mornings are also when I attend to my priorty activities. So yes, nothing before 11am. 

About this site

My personal website and the way I am going about it has been inspired by the personal websites of Paul Graham and Derek Sivers. 

No comments no tracking

The site is devoid of any form of commenting, tracking or analytics. Prefer it that way. Easier on the mind and on the code. 

All my notes are drafts

I tend to publish immediately after I have written and look to get back at a later point to refine them if at all.
