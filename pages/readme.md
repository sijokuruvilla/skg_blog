# Circket is my first love
# All my notes are drafts
# No tracking, no comments



# I don't accept mementos

I don't accept mementos. I acknowledge its a gesture but wish to respect the fact that its an inconvenience to me - just plain carrying it back, keepig it at my place and throwing it away at a later point in time.  Different people have different prefernces and ways of viewing things. This is respecting mine. 

# I don't carry a business card

I don't. I don't intend to have one also anymore. One quick search with my name will get you my email. You don't need a card anymore. 

# I don't pick up calls from unknown numbers

 I don't pick calls from unknown numbers. I just don't. I also don't save most numbers on my phone. 

# I don't do connects

I don't do connects. You may mail the person you wish to connect to and mark me in cc. That also makes it easier for me to put in a word if I wish to.
