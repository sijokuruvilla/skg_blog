Early years

Rethink

# I don't accept mementos

I don't accept mementos. I acknowledge its a gesture but wish to respect the fact that its an inconvenience to me - just plain carrying it back, keepig it at my place and throwing it away at a later point in time.  Different people have different prefernces and ways of viewing things. This is respecting mine. 

# I don't carry a business card

I don't. I don't intend to have one also anymore. One quick search with my name will get you my email. You don't need a card anymore. 

# I don't pick up calls from unknown numbers

 I don't pick calls from unknown numbers. I just don't. I also don't save most numbers on my phone. 

# I don't do connects

I don't do connects. You may mail the person you wish to connect to and mark me in cc. That also makes it easier for me to put in a word if I wish to. 




# Copy & innovate

My personal website and the way I am going about it has been heavily inspired by the personal websites of Paul Graham and Derek Sivers. Elements I really liked I have attempted to copy as it is. 

# Nothing before 11am

This will have to be my default response to anyone who asks me for calls or meetings or anything of that sort. My mornings belong to me. I am a morning person and mornings happen to be my most productive time. Mornings are also when I attend to my priorty activities. So yes, nothing before 11am. 
 
# All my notes are drafts

All my notes may be treated as drafts. It needs to be reviewed, edited and rewritten. I tend to publish immediately after I have written and look to get back at a later point to refine them. Sometimes I do and most times I don't. This approach runs the risk of some or most notes not making it to their final drafts. With the publish only after review approach, I run the risk of some (or most) notes never being published. I choose the former. 

# Mail works best

Email would be the best way to reach me  <br>
All other DM platforms (SM, chats, twitter etc) I will be infrequent <br>
I also prefer not to be reached on my phone unless its both important & urgent <br>
